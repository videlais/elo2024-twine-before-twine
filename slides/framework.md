# Framework

We examine the past to better understand the present (Parikka, 2012). Research drawing from media archaeology instructs us to examine **"nonlinear strata,"** the points where the material past collide with the digital present (Parikka, 2015); we look for where **"past is brought to the present, and the present to the past"** (Huhtamo & Parikka, 2011).

From critical code studies, we gain the importance of **"examining the changes to programs over time [as] a useful strategy for understanding the life of the code, how it made its current form known to its developers"** (p. 234). We best understand code as influenced by developers, community, and changes in response to different needs (Marino, 2020).
