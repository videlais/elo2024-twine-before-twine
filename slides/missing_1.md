# Missing Past (1)

Let begin with what is commonly thought of as the first major academic reference:

**"Although Twine was released in 2009, with consistent updates thereafter, there is little indication of it having much use in the first year or so of its creation [...] Despite interest in having contests and competitions for Twine games, the IF Wiki lists zero Twine entries for 2009, 2010, and 2011."**
