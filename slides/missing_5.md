# Missing Past (5)

After some discussion with Chris Klimas about the best place to put it, he and I worked on a revision as part of grouping by major and minor version and then filling out different parts.

You can now find all of this work as part of a set of pages called ["Release Notes"](https://twinery.org/reference/en/release-notes/index.html) in the Twine Reference Guide officially added on January 3, 2024, as part of the release of Twine 2.8.1.

We now have an exact history of every major version from Twee 1.0.0 on March 28, 2006, through Twine 2.9.0 on June 16, 2024, rough a month ago as of this presentation.
